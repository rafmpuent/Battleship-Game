# Battleship-Game
Battleship-G01-P109 is a customized version of the classic Battleship game implemented using an ESP32 microcontroller. The gaming experience has been enhanced by incorporating WS2812B LEDs to visually display ship positions, two joysticks per player for ship movement control, and two OLED displays to showcase crucial game information. There is also a mobile application, developed in App Inventor, that allows players to enter their names via Wi-Fi connection. Knowing the name of the players is crucial, since there is also a link to the FireBase database to record the names of the players, their successful shots and their missed shots.
